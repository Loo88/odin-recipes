    <h2 class="headp">Description</h2>
    <p class="polop">Polo (a Central Asian variant on the word pilaf) is a staple accross Central Asia including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and parts of North Western China. The different peoples of the region have their own takes, and flavours, for the recipe.</p>
    
    <p class="polop">This recipe is for Uyghur polo, the variant found in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. Uyghur food is on the whole closer to Turkish, Persian or Mediterranean food than it is to conventional Chinese food. The recipe can be a challenge to cook correctly at first, but the challenge will prove well worth it because the dish is absolutely delicious.</p>
