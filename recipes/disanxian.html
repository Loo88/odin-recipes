    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Disanxian a popular dish from Northern China can literally be translated as 'three treasures of the earth'. It's made using the three most common vegetables found at a Chinese Market, namely eggplant, potato and pepper.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggplants</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of corn flower for coating</li>
      <li>1 potato (cut into thick slices)</li>
      <li>1 green pepper (broadly sliced)</li>
      <li>1 green onion (chopped)</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves (chopped)</li>
      <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Stir-Frying Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp. light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp. dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp. cornstarch</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. water</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>soak the eggplants in slightly salted water for 15 minutes, drain, and then coat with a thin layer of cornstarch</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, mix together the stir-frying sauce ingredients</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a wok (adding more oil will expediate the process; don't worry about using too much oil, as it can be removed later)</li>
      <li>First fry the potatoes until well-done. Then add the eggplant and fry. Lastly, add and fry the green peppers for less than 1 minute</li>
      <li>Pour out the excess oil, leaving only a small amount for the last step. Add the chopped green onion and garlic until aromatic</li>
      <li>Pour in the stir-frying oil and simmer until all the ingredients are well-coated</li>
      <li>Serve with steamed rice</li>
    </ol>
